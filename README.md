# Waterloo-CCC-Solutions

Canadian Computing Competition is hosted by the University of Waterloo annually for all high school students across the world.
For further information on the problem set from past years, refer to : https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/ 

I have added some of my code that I have been personally written when I was attempting these problems. I have posted mainly the senior level questions from past years. Since some of these problems are very difficult, some solutions are partially correc, passing some cases but not all.
Most of these problems revolve around: graph theory, recursion and algorithms. 

Hopefully this helped!

# Waterloo-CCC-Solutions

Canadian Computing Competition is annually hosted by the University of Waterloo for all high school students across the world.
For further information on the problem set from past years, refer to : https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/ 

I have added some of my code that I have personally written when I was attempting these problems. I have posted mainly the senior level questions from past years. Since some of these problems are very difficult, some solutions are partially correct, passing some cases but not all. Most of the problems that I was interested in revolve around: graph theory, recursion and algorithms. 

Hopefully this helped!
